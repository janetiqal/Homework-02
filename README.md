## Name of Assignment
Homework-02 Personal Portfolio
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to build a personal portfolio so future employers can see what I can accomplish using the skills I have learned in my full stack coding bootcamp. Future employers can come my my page and view what I am currently working on or the things I have built so far. To build this page, I was asked to use everything I have learned so far from the HTML and CSS modules. 
## My Experience
I was able to write the HTML code with ease but struggled slightly when it came to styling with CSS. Specifically, styling the section titled "My Work". I realized in order to use flexbox appropriatley, I needed to give each section a parent div that would be flexed. I gave that div a class of 
"container". I went as far as copying my html and and creating a new folder and titling it "Practice Portfolio" and started a new CSS sheet to see where I was making the mistake in my page. Once I figured it out I was able to get the 4 smaller image pictures of my applications to fall in line with by giving it a parent container and flexing that. I used place holder images since I have no work to include in my portfolio at the moment. Click on each application image sends you to my github page. 
I set media queries for three screen sizes, orginally max-width 992px, max-width: 768px, and max-width 500px. I saw better results giving each media querry a range. I ended up with min-width: 768.1px to 992px, 580px to 768px, and created a media querry for phone sizes that landed between 320px t0 580px. 
I am proud to stand by the page I created but I look forward to revisiting this page soon and making changes to it with the new techniques I am constantly learning.
